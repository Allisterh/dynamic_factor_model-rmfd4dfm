\title{NO EXPORT:: Cumulate IRFs for variables in differences}
\usage{
cum_irf(irf_array, trans_ix)
}
\arguments{
\item{irf_array}{\eqn{(N x q x (h+1))} array containing the impulse response function, with \eqn{N} denoting
the number of variables, q the number of shocks, h the number of periods IRFs are plotted ahead}

\item{trans_ix}{vector of transformation codes according in McCracken & Ng (JME, 2016) format}
}
\value{
\eqn{(N x q x (h+1))} array containing the cumulated IRFs
}
\description{
This function cumulates IRFs such that variables in first and second differences
are cumulated once and twice, respectively.
}
