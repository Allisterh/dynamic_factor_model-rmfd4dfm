Description: This package contains the necessary functions and data for a
    replication of the results in [1]. In particular, we provide functions
    for the parametrization of right matrix fraction description (RMFD) in
    echelon form and a subsequent estimation of the model using the EM
    algorithm. The goal of the main functions is to produce structural
    IRFs as outlined in [1]. Additionally we provide functions for the
    estimation of structural IRFs given in [2]. This package builds on
    packages rationalmatrices and RLDM authored by Bernd Funovits and
    Wolfgang Scherrer. Since these packages may change and to ensure the
    functioning of the package, we put the necessary functions from the
    current versions of these packages into R scripts zz_ratmat.R and
    zz_RLDM.R. References: [1] Koistinen, J., and Funovits, B. (2022).
